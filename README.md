# Practical Molecular Simulations

**Welcome to the official course resources for "Molecular Simulations for Engineers" (also known as "Advanced Molecular Simulations") at Rowan University.**

I personally like to call this course **"Practical Molecular Simulations"** because our primary goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical statistical mechanics and the actual day-to-day work of running simulations on high-performance supercomputers.

Whether you are a student currently enrolled in the class or a visitor from the internet interested in learning, you are welcome here!

:::{note} Course Status: Active Development
**Current Semester:** Spring 2026
These resources are currently being developed and updated weekly to match the course schedule. If you are visiting after Spring 2026, the content remains available as an archive, with occasional updates as time permits.

## About This Course
The world of molecular simulations is vast—spanning from quantum chemistry to coarse-grained biological models. A single course cannot cover everything.

**Our Aim:**
1.  **Fundamentals:** Provide a practical introduction to the physics governing molecular motion.
2.  **Hands-on Skills:** Teach the actual workflow of setting up, running, and analyzing simulations using modern tools.
3.  **Getting Started:** Help you overcome the initial steep learning curve so you can apply these tools to your own engineering or scientific problems.

## Disclaimer & Contact
These resources are built to support the class, utilizing a combination of lecture materials, official documentation, and AI-assisted drafting tools.

:::{warning} Accuracy and Liability
We have tried our best to fact-check all materials presented here. However, given the rapid pace of software development and the complexity of the subject, errors may exist.

* **We do not take responsibility for the absolute accuracy of all resources.**
* **Always verify results** against standard textbooks and official software documentation.
* If you find errors, bugs, or confusing sections, please reach out to **Dr. Aditya Lele** at `lele@rowan.edu`.
