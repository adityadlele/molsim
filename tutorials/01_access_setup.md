# Tutorial 1: Setup NSF ACCESS Account

**Assignment 0 (Pass/Fail)**
* **Due:** Thursday, January 22, 2026 by 11:59 PM
* **Points:** 0 (Strictly Required for Course Access)

:::{danger} CRITICAL DEADLINE WARNING
**Do not ignore this deadline.**

After you submit your ID, I must manually add you to the allocation. This process triggers a synchronization with the supercomputer which can take up to 24 hours.

**If you do not submit your ID by Thursday night, you will NOT have access to the cluster for next week's lab session.** You will physically be in class but unable to log in or complete the work.
:::

## Objective
In this course, we will utilize the **Purdue Anvil** supercomputer to run molecular dynamics simulations. Access to this resource is managed through the National Science Foundation's **ACCESS** program.

To grant you permission to use the supercomputer, you must create an ACCESS User ID. I will then add your ID to the class allocation project.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Check for an Existing Account
If you have used an NSF supercomputer (like Anvil, Bridges-2, Stampede2, or Expanse) in a previous class or research project, you likely already have an ACCESS ID.

* **Do not** create a duplicate account.
* Log in to [identity.access-ci.org](https://identity.access-ci.org/) to confirm your username.
* Skip to **Step 3** if you already have an ID.

### Step 2: Create a New Account
If you are new to NSF HPC resources, follow the official instructions here:
<https://operations.access-ci.org/identity/new-user>

1.  Navigate to the [ACCESS Registration Page](https://registry.access-ci.org/registry/ci_logon_registry/register).
2.  **Identity Provider:** Select **Rowan University** (via CILogon) if available. This links your university credentials to the system.
3.  **Registration Email:** You **must** use your **Rowan University email address** (`@rowan.edu`) for your profile registration. Do not use Gmail or other personal addresses.
4.  **Username:** You will be asked to choose (or be assigned) a unique **ACCESS ID**.
    * *Note:* This ID is often different from your Rowan email handle. It usually consists of letters and numbers (e.g., `jdoe01`).
5.  Accept the Terms of Use and finalize the account.

### Step 3: Submission
Once you have created your account:

1.  Log in to Canvas and navigate to **Assignment 0**.
2.  In the submission text box, type your **ACCESS ID** (Case sensitive).
3.  **Example Submission:** `alele`

## Summary Checklist
- [ ] I have an active ACCESS ID.
- [ ] I registered using my `@rowan.edu` email address.
- [ ] I have submitted my specific ACCESS ID (not my email) to Canvas.
